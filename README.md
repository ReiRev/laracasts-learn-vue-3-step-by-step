- [ ] Also show the length of `Hello, World` using javascript.
- [ ] Change the text based on the value entered in the input field, using Vueâ€™s two-way binding.
- [ ] Change the message to `Changed` 3 seconds after the page has loaded.

### 02-Attribute Binding and Event Handling

- [ ] Create a button and add a CSS style to put it to the center of the screen.

- [ ] Toggle the color of the button when it's clicked.

### 03-Lists, Conditionals, and Computed Properties

- [ ] Create a section which contains heading and three unordered assignment lists with checkbox.
- [ ] Style the html with Tailwind.
- [ ] List the assignments from the Vue's data source.
- [ ] Change the assignment to complete when checkbox is checked. Confirm that the data is changed with showing it.
- [ ] Divide the section into "In Progress" and "Completed". Show proper assignments in each sections.
- [ ] Show the "Completed" section only if there are corresponding assignments. Try two different ways.
- [ ] Use computed properties to do the same things.

### 04-Your First Custom Vue Components

- [ ] Create a `app-button` component which is gray but become darker when it's hovered. Show it in the browser.
- [ ] Show the text content in the `app-button`.
- [ ] When the property `processing` is true, don't allow the cursor.

### 05-One Vue Component Per File

- [ ] Move `app-button` component to a single file.
- [ ] Fix `index.html` so that it works the same as before.

### 06-Component Props

- [ ] Move `App` component to a single file and fix `index.html`.

- [ ] Change the style of the `app-button` based on the value of `type` property. The possible values are `primary`, `secondary`, `muted`.
- [ ] Change the `processing` to a property. Then show the spinner when `processing` is true. You can get the spinner snippet from [here](https://stephanwagner.me/only-css-loading-spinner).

### 07-Bring it All Together

- [ ] Copy the `section`s in the episode 3 and paste them to `template` of `App.js`. Similarly, copy and paste `data` and `computed`. You can copy the code from [here](https://github.com/ReiRev/laracasts-learn-vue-3-step-by-step/blob/03-lists-conditionals-and-computed-properties/index.html).
